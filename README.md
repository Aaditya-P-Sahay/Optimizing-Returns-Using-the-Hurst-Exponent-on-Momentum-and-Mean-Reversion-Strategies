#  Hurst Exponent Trading Strategy Implementation

A comprehensive implementation of the Cornell Data Science paper: **"Optimizing Returns Using the Hurst Exponent and Q-Learning on Momentum and Mean Reversion Strategies"** by Chang, Lizardi, and Shah.

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use the **Hurst exponent** to intelligently switch between momentum and mean reversion trading strategies. The key insight: different strategies work better under different market conditions, and the Hurst exponent can help identify which strategy to use when.

###  What We Explore
- **100 carefully selected large-cap stocks** from diverse sectors
- **Hurst exponent calculation** to classify market behavior (trending vs mean-reverting)
- **SMA crossover strategy** for trending assets (momentum trading)
- **Bollinger Bands strategy** for mean-reverting assets (mean reversion trading)
- **Risk-return optimization** through dynamic boundary adjustment

###  Key Research Finding
> Different trading strategies have **opposite characteristics**. By using the Hurst exponent to identify whether a stock is trending or mean-reverting, we can apply the most suitable strategy and optimize our risk-return profile.

- **What to expect:**
  ```
   SMA CROSSOVER STRATEGY PERFORMANCE:
  Mean Return      : 0.0234 (2.34%)
  Median Return    : 0.0156 (1.56%)
  Standard Deviation: 0.0890 (8.90%)
  ```
- **Visual:** Blue histogram showing return distribution

###  **Cell 5: Bollinger Bands Strategy (Mean Reversion)**
**What it does:** Applies mean reversion trading strategy to all 100 stocks
- **Runtime:** 4-6 minutes
- **Output:** Performance statistics and side-by-side comparison with SMA
- **What to expect:**
  ```
   BOLLINGER BANDS STRATEGY PERFORMANCE:

  ```
  STRATEGY PERFORMANCE COMPARISON:
  Strategy         | Mean Return | Std Deviation | Sharpe Ratio

##  Expected Results

Based on the Cornell paper methodology, you should see:

| Strategy Type | Expected Characteristics |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| **SMA (Momentum)** | Lower returns, lower risk, frequent small losses with occasional large gains |
| **Bollinger Bands (Mean Reversion)** | Higher returns, higher risk, frequent small wins with occasional large losses |
| **Balanced Hurst** | Interpolated performance between the two pure strategies |

##  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Module not found" errors:**
- Ensure Cell 1 (package installation) completed successfully
- Restart runtime: `Runtime ‚Üí Restart and run all`

**"Download failed" for some stocks:**
- Normal behavior - some stocks may have data issues
- The notebook handles this gracefully and continues with available data

**Widgets not displaying in Cell 8:**
- Refresh the page and re-run Cell 8
- Ensure you're using Chrome/Firefox for best compatibility

**Slow execution:**
- Normal for data-intensive operations
- Each data download cell (3, 4, 5) takes several minutes
- **Do not interrupt** - let cells complete fully
